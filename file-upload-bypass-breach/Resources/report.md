# file-upload-bypass-breach

## Vulnerability Details:

### Affected URL: `http://{IP_ADDR}/index.php?page=upload`

### Issue Description:
The `http://{IP_ADDR}/index.php?page=upload` endpoint of the application is vulnerable to a file upload bypass vulnerability. Despite claiming to only accept image files, the endpoint does not properly enforce this restriction, allowing non-image files to be uploaded.

## Potential Exploitation:
Here are some risks associated with this scenario:

* Unrestricted File Upload:
    The lack of proper file type validation allows an attacker to upload potentially malicious files, including scripts or executables, which could lead to various security risks such as code execution, data breaches, or server compromise.

* Content Spoofing:
    Attackers can disguise non-image files as image files to deceive users and potentially execute malicious code on their systems. This could lead to further exploitation or compromise of user devices.

## Immediate Action Required:
To mitigate this risk, we recommend the following actions be taken immediately:

* Enforce Strict File Type Validation:
    Implement rigorous validation checks to ensure that only allowed file types (e.g., images) are accepted for upload. This should be based on file content inspection rather than relying solely on file extensions.

* Implement Proper Content-Type Handling:
    Ensure that the server verifies the Content-Type header of uploaded files matches the expected file type. Additionally, perform server-side checks to confirm the integrity and format of uploaded files.

* Secure File Storage and Processing:
    Store uploaded files in a secure location with restricted access permissions to prevent unauthorized access or execution. Implement measures to sanitize and validate uploaded files before processing them to mitigate potential security risks.

* Regular Security Audits and Testing:
    Conduct regular security assessments, including penetration testing and code reviews, to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in the application, including file upload vulnerabilities. Keep software dependencies and libraries up to date to mitigate known security issues.

* Educate Users and Administrators:
    Raise awareness among users and administrators about the risks associated with file uploads and the importance of exercising caution when handling uploaded files. Provide guidelines for securely uploading and handling files to minimize the likelihood of exploitation.

## Exploitation Example:
To demonstrate the vulnerability, an attacker could exploit the insecure file upload functionality using the following command:

```bash
curl -X POST -F "Upload=Upload" -F "uploaded=@{filename};type=image/jpeg" http://{IP_ADDR}/\?page\=upload
